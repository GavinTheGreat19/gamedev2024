    <h1>Artificial Intelligence, and it's application in Education</h1>

    <p><b>As Artificial Intelligence technology grows, it is important to find proper uses and applications for the technology.<br><br>

        As of now, the uses of AI in an educational setting has been limited to creating poorly written essays and proof-reading of subpar English work. But now, with emerging technologies from the last three years of Large Language Models, AI is growing more practical use cases in Education. <br><br>
        
        One such example is the mlsysbook.ai project developed by Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi of Harvard University. He suggests a world where AI adapts based on the world around it, to act as the perfect assistant for the everyday human. Contributing to all aspects of life, from Driving Routes, Sleeping Schedules, to Music Apps and even Education. <br><br>
        
         
        He has developed an example system of his application of AI technology in the Education world. An AI that can summarize reading material and develop smart quizzes for the individual learning requirements and abilities. A far growth from previous applications of AI. <br><br>
        
        The AI can generate graphs based on the individual studentâ€™s learning behaviors and progress (see below). <br><br>
