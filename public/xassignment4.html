    <h2 style= "text-align: center;"><i>By GavinTheGreat19</i></h2>

    <p>As the amount of AI technology continues to grow, so too should our uses for it. LLMs are likely to be the greatest piece of technology to come out of this decade, and it's important that we find uses for it beyond giving us the incorrect number of Rs in the word Strawberry.</p>
    <p>I have used the 3D Software, Blender, as well as Microsoft's AI; Copilot, to generate a Python script capable of automating the animation process.</p>
