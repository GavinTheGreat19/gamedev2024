    <h1>>Encryption:</h1>
    <p class="indent">Encryption, what is it? Encrpytion is the process of taking words or other forms of information and turning them into a code, to prevent unauthrized access. The most famous example of Encryption is the "Ceaser Cipher".
    A method of turning letters into code by shifting the letter by a random number. This number was known as the key, and only the person with the key could decrypt the code back into information. In the modern day, the Ceaser Cipher isn't secure
    It was cracked many years ago, and our computers can try all possible combonations for a ceaser in a fraction of a second.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">Now, to avoid unsavory hackers from hacking our passwords and bank accounts, new methods had to be engineered. such as Base64 Encryption.</p>
